## General Info

General information about RCS Python Workshops can be found in the [Python Workshops Repository](https://github.com/nuitrcs/pythonworkshops).  This includes information about software installations and general Python resources.

## Prep

In order to focus on Deep learning and Tensorflow characteristics and not to be distracted with the installations and possible problems with versioning or other issues, we will work from Google Colab using this repository. 

Therefore, there is no need to install nor download anything - You will work from notebooks directly in the Google Colab. Following the steps below:
- Log in to Google
- Open Google colab following this link [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) 
- There should be an opportunity to find Github tab and enter [https://github.com/nuitrcs/Python-Tensorflow](https://github.com/nuitrcs/Python-Tensorflow)
- Open the notebook we are working on
- If not you could:
>- Find the tab File
>- Find the tab open notebook
>- Find the tab github 
>- Enter a following Github URL [https://github.com/nuitrcs/Python-Tensorflow](https://github.com/nuitrcs/Python-Tensorflow)
>>- It might happen that you need to open [https://github.com/nuitrcs](https://github.com/nuitrcs) and only from there to find Python-Tensorflow
>- Open the notebook we are working on

We will go through the above steps together

## Tensorflow Workshop Overview

### Objective of the workshop

Learn the foundations of, and practice the skills necessary to do deep learning with Tensorflow

### Learning outcomes

* What is Tensorflow and how to set it up
*	What types of problems deep learning can help with
*	What tensors are and how to work with them
*	Build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks on two image datasets
*	Evaluate model performance


### Resources

General Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep learning resources:

[Data Science Central](https://www.datasciencecentral.com) - A great online group of data science enthusiasts where you can find everything related to machine learning, predictive modeling, data science and more.

[KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/) - A great source of news anything ML and Data Science. 

[Towards Data Science](http://www.towardsdatascience.com) - Place to share concepts, ideas and code

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edx](https://www.edx.org/), [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Kadenze](http://www.kadenze.com) courses. I would strongly recommend Andrew Ng's machine learning courses. 

It is important to learn about word2vec and this is an interesting starting point:
